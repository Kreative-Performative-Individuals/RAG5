      "1. **Pupils**: Bunny pupils are vertical slit-like openings that can adjust to different light levels. In bright light, the pupils constrict (get smaller), while in low light, they dilate (get larger).\n",
      "2. **Color vision**: Rabbits have limited color vision compared to humans. They can see blues and yellows but struggle with reds and greens.\n",
      "3. **Eye structure**: Bunny eyes are made up of a white sclera (the outer layer) and a pink iris (the colored part). The iris contains light-sensitive cells called photoreceptors, which convert light into electrical signals that the brain interprets as vision.\n",
